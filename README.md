A scalable and production-oriented News Application built using **Flutter**. This project demonstrates the implementation of **Clean Architecture** principles, separating the codebase into Domain, Data, and Presentation layers to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## 🚀 Project Overview

News App is a cross-platform mobile application that simulates a real-world production environment. It allows users to:

- **Browse Top Headlines:** Real-time news fetching from global sources.
- **Dynamic Search:** Search for articles by keywords or specific topics.
- **Multi-language Support:** Fully localized in **Arabic** and **English** (RTL/LTR support).
- **Responsive UI:** Adaptive design that looks great on all screen sizes using `flutter_screenutil`.
- **Clean Navigation:** Declarative routing using `go_router`.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

The project strictly follows **Clean Architecture** divided into three independent layers:

1.  **Domain Layer:** The inner core containing Entities, Use Cases, and Repository Interfaces. It has **zero dependencies** on other layers.
2.  **Data Layer:** Handles data retrieval. It contains Models, Data Sources (Remote/Local), and Repository Implementations.
3.  **Presentation Layer:** The UI layer containing Screens, Widgets, and State Management (Cubits).
